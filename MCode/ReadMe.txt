This folder contains all of the Matlab code related to the feature variability analysis and impact.

Use the function: "Examples_variability_Analysis.m" to plot the relative difference between tools results for shape, intensity and texture as in the book chapter
Use the function: "feature_variability_impact_kfold.m" to compute all the results of the feature variability impact
Use the function: "plot_feature_variability_impact_kfold.m" to plot the results of the feature variability impact
The file "OUTPUT_kfold.mat" has all the output of the feature variability impact as a ecll array of 10 runs, each cell array contains the resulting table for each run
